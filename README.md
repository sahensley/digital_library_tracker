# digital_library_tracker

Digital Library Tracker is a Django web application to used to keep track of
games, eBooks, music and gift codes across various platforms.  The main goal is
to know if a product is owned in at least one platform, and if a gift code
exists.  This is currently a work in progress and is a rewrite of Digital Code
Manager.
